# Spark-DS-example
Illustration of how to use Apache Spark to analyse raw data, for MLSD meetup GBG 2015

The example is an attempt to do unsupervised graph clustering of VÃ¤sttrafik stops using timetable pdfs converted to txt files (stored in timetables.tar.gz). The model is a power iteration graph clustering algorithm.

# Running

1) Download apache spark binary suitable for your OS, and R if not installed either. 
```brew install apache-spark``` for Mac OS X for example.

2) Run the following code to execute the spark python script from a terminal:
```spark-submit --driver-memory=6G py/readPdfs.py```

The code automatically extracts the timetable files so no need to do it manually.

This might take a while, since it parses more than 5k files, parses them and trains a model. 

3) Visualise the result and compare PIC with Louvain graph clustering done in R.

```R -f R/plotgraph.R```

Plots saved in plots/ directory.
